    "**Gradient Descent** gives one way of minimizing $J(\\theta)$. Let's discuss other way of doing so, this time performing the minimization explicitly and without resorting to an iterative algorithm. In the **Normal Equation** method, we will minimize $J$ by explicitly taking its derivatives with respect to the $\\theta_{j}$, and setting them to zero. This allows us to find the optimum $\\theta$ without iteration. The normal equation formula is given below:\n",
